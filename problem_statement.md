# GenAI Route Recommendation for Travel: A Web Application

## Objective:
Travelers typically have trouble planning trips. Existing planning tools normally optimize for the single shortest or cheapest path, leaving the users to manually configure the rest. Instead, we aim to build a GenAI-driven web application that creates holistic and highly personalized travel routes by reasoning in natural language, together with pre-stored user preferences. 

## What are the main functionalities? 
### Conversational Trip Builder  
Users interact with the AI-assistant (“I have 5 days in Italy, love Renaissance art, and prefer trains over flights”), and the system constructs an end-to-end itinerary with optimal routes, transport modes, and timing.

### Preference-Aware Optimization  
The application weighs user-set priorities, which are persistently stored by the system (budget, scenic value, accessibility) instead of a single metric, surfacing ranked route options.

### Reliable Recommendations  
With the help of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our system recommends real-world attractions backed by up-to-date facts retrieved from trusted sources. 

### Google Map API Integration  
We integrate the Google Maps API into our web application to provide an interactive, visual representation of the travel routes generated by our system.

## Who are the intended users?
**Independent Travelers** wanting bespoke routes without a human travel agent.  
**Industry Partners (Ticket Booking Platform)** can integrate our API to offer intelligent, personalized route planning directly within their services.

## How will you integrate GenAI meaningfully?
We meaningfully integrate GenAI as a conversational planner that interprets user input, reasons over preferences, and generates personalized itineraries. By combining LLMs with RAG, the system ensures recommendations are fact-based and up-to-date. Stored user preferences enable preference-aware optimization across sessions. The AI could also let users iteratively adjust their plans. Finally, natural language outputs are paired with Google Maps visualizations.

## Describe some scenarios how your app will function?
1\. User: “I want a three-day budget-friendly road trip from Berlin to the Alps, must include Neuschwanstein Castle.” ↦ 2\. The model presents relevant routes with cost breakdowns, hotel suggestions, and EV-charging stops.
