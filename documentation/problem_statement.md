# GenAI Route Recommendation for Travel: A Web Application

## Main Functionality

Travelers typically have trouble planning trips. Existing planning tools normally optimize for the single shortest or cheapest path, leaving the users to manually configure the rest. Instead, we aim to build a GenAI-driven web application that creates holistic and highly personalized travel routes by reasoning in natural language, together with pre-stored user preferences.

### Conversational Trip Builder

Build multi-day travel itineraries based on natural language prompts (e.g., “I want to spend 5 days in Italy, love Renaissance art, and prefer trains over planes”).

### Preference-Aware Route Optimization

Respect stored user preferences such as budget, travel mode, scenic value, and accessibility;

### Reliable Real-World Recommendations

Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to suggest up-to-date and relevant places, events, and accommodations based on trusted travel data sources.

### Interactive Route Visualization

Display suggested travel routes and points of interest using Google Maps integration.

## Intended Users

- Independent Travelers seeking personalized travel itineraries without relying on travel agents.

- Digital Nomads planning flexible, multi-city travel based on preferences like internet speed, work-friendly cafés, etc.

- Erasmus/Exchange Students exploring Europe during holidays with budget or time constraints.

- Industry Partners (e.g. Booking Platforms) wishing to offer integrated route recommendations via API.

## GenAI Integration

- Conversational Planning: Users communicate in natural language to describe their goals; the LLM understands intent and transforms it into actionable travel plans.

- Iterative Personalization: GenAI learns from user feedback and refines itinerary suggestions across multiple interactions.

- Fact-Based Retrieval: Use RAG to ensure that recommendations (e.g., opening hours, pricing, event availability) are always grounded in real-world, retrievable data.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Backpacker Planning a Scenic Route

- User: Leo, a 24-year-old solo traveler
- Goal: Plan a scenic and affordable 7-day train journey across Southern Germany.

- Flow:

  - Leo enters: “I want a scenic train journey for 7 days across Bavaria, visiting castles and small towns, budget under €600.”

  - The assistant suggests three route combinations with scenic rail options and cultural stops.

  - Leo gives feedback (“More hiking, fewer museums”) and the AI refines the plan.

### Scenario 2: Family Planning Summer Vacation

- User: Marie and Thomas, traveling with two kids
- Goal: Find a kid-friendly route with short driving times, play areas, and budget hotels.

- Flow:

  - They describe their preferences: “No more than 3 hours driving per day, fun for 7 and 10-year-olds, need pool or playground.”

  - AI builds a 5-day car trip with daily distances under 200km, stopping at family-friendly attractions.

  - They save the plan to their shared calendar.

### Scenario 3: Exchange Student Weekend Trip

- User: Julia, a student in Munich
- Goal: Use a long weekend to explore nearby cities on a budget.

- Flow:

  - Julia says: “3-day weekend, low-cost trip from Munich, maybe Salzburg or Prague.”

  - The tool suggests a bus/train, must-see attractions, and total cost estimates.

  - Julia chooses a Salzburg itinerary.

### Scenario 4: Digital Nomad Long-Term Exploration

- User: Kevin, working remotely from Europe
- Goal: Spend 4 weeks in multiple cities with good coworking options.

- Flow:

  - Kevin enters: “I want to travel across Spain for a month, work remotely, need coworking spaces and strong Wi-Fi.”

  - GenAI builds a route of 4 cities with reliable work environments, affordable Airbnbs, and leisure options.

  - Includes productivity time blocks and local SIM card suggestions.
